# What is this?
In this repository you will find my solutions to the problem sets given by Harvard's CS50.<br>
**Disclaimer:** The upload dates do not represent my actual completion dates.

# Difficulties faced so far:
## 1. Pointers:
It took me a very long time to understand pointers because they were just too confusing for a beginner like me but the problems in pset4 allowed me to have a better grasp of them. As someone who understands things better when presented in a visual format, writing a data structure out in C showed me how pointers worked and how powerful they could be.
## 2. Logic:
Being inexperienced, I find it slightly difficult to write out code that are efficient in nature and sometimes take long-winded approaches to something that can be done easily though I feel that with more practice it will only get better from there.
