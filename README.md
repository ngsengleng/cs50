# About me
<p>I briefly dabbled in C back in the school days and played around with image processing using OpenCV on c++ with a rather crude camera and a programmable circuit board and this basically sums up my exposure to the programming languages. I also programmed robots (specifically LEGO mindstorm) using their programming software for a good 2 years to participate in competitions held in Singapore.</p>
